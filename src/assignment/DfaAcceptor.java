	/*
		Constructor - take in as parameter a Dfa object and store it as a field

		define a boolean method accept() with a string parameter that determines if the Dfa should accept the string or not
			->> SEE THE DFA-RECOGNISE ALGORITHM IN THE COMP314 SLIDES
			->> this method should use the transition table of the Dfa object to determine if the string must be accepted or ont
				->> Study the DfaState and Dfa class (and also the Notes.txt file I made earlier) to understand how it works
					->> Divya and I are not entirely completed with the code, but assume that everything works when coding this class
						i.e. The transition table is created correctly etc.
